epi_auth_client
==============================

This library supports 2 types of authentication methods. Both the methods return a JWT token which you can use to make
api calls for enterprise-api on production.

Username and password authentication:
============================================================

**Usage:**

1. import epi_auth_client

2. jwt_token = epi_auth_client.user_name_pwd_authentication("your_user_name", "your_password")

PKI authentication:
==============================

This type of authentication needs a private key and a client ID to generate the JWT token.

**Usage:**

1. import epi_auth_client

2. Paste your private key:

        key = '''

        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

        Your private key goes here

        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----'''

3. jwt_token = epi_auth_client.pki_authentication("your_user_name", "your_client_id", key)

**Note: If you get the error "ValueError: Could not deserialize key data." when doing PKI authentication, make sure that your private key is properly formatted. Paste the private key as a multi-line string in python.**

**Correct way:**

The following is the right way to paste your private key.


    '''

    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

    Your private key goes here

    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----'''

**Wrong way:**

Pasting the private key as follows would throw the error "ValueError: Could not deserialize key data." because there are extra spaces on each line in the key.


       '''

            -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

            Your private key goes here

            -----END PRIVATE KEY-----'''
